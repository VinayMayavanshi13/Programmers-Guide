## How to choose a Programming Language?
It does not matter which first programming language you learn. It may be C if you are a college student or C++, Java maybe.

It depends on what aspire you to become a coder?, Building websites?, Apps?, Games?, Machine Learning?, AI? and so on.

If you want to build websites then choose JavaScript, For Android Apps choose Kotlin or Java or Swift for IOS, For Machine Learning go with python.

If somebody come up to me and say - "Hey, I want to learn a programming language. I am not sure what to start with"

Then I will only ask I follow up question - What you want to build? - Websites or Apps ? 

For Website - JavaScript, For Apps - Kotlin.

Once you have learn one programming language. It doesn't take even a week to learn other. OfCourse mastery will take some time.

## How to learn a Programming Language :

Learn about Data types, Input and Output format, Syntax Style, Functions, Arrays, Multidimensional Arrays, Rotation in arrays, Lists, Vectors.

Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Count Sort, Binary Search, LinearSearch.

Time Complexity and Space Complexity.

Do interview questions on Arrays, Number theory and Bit masking, Check advantages of bit masking and cost effectiveness, Strings.

Learn about Stack and heap memory, Static and dynamic memory allocation Recursion, Backtracking, Problems on recursion and backtracking like maze problem,suduko, N Queue Problem,Dynamic Arrays And it's Interview Question.

String + Recursion Problem

Now learn about OOP i.e Object Oriented Programming.

Fast and slow pointers, Cycle detection problem, Binary trees, DFS and BFS, AVL trees, Red black trees then Tries.

Heaps and Hash maps, Dynamic Programming.

Do not give more than 30 minutes to a problem or at Max 40 minutes.

If you are not able to solve in the first attempt don't be dishearten, go for the hint and try. Still can't make it ? No Problem. See the Solution, Then Come back to same problem after a Week.

In solution, first try to came up with the easy solution. Don't worry about time complexity. Once you are confident of the naive solution then think can you make it faster, more efficient ? Then look for optimization.

This you could achieve in three months after this do Regular Practice. 

Doing just leetcode is enough.

Moving ahead build projects, explore more things into the computer science world.

Don't fall into the hell of Development v/s Competetive Programming questions. In the industry as an software engineer you will be involve in development. So learn about the tech stacks use in the industry. Learn about system design. Take MOOC Courses by MIT, Stanford, UC Berkley and so on. As far as interview is concerned there competetive programming is often recommended as a form of time bound practice. I have seen many students including my classmates get into Competetive Programming only to have a good rating as they think this will make the interviewer happy. They don't really enjoy it. They do it only for the sake of validation. Also there are genuine candidates out there who love Competetive Programming and make it to ICPC. So don't just follow the herd, think whether you like it or not then choose what you want to do? But If you ask me then I'll always prefer development as I love development. 

## Tutorial Hell
People have limited capacity to process information. There’s a mountain of information in the world and you constantly have to choose what you pay attention to. It’s cognitive overload. This leads to tutorial hell,you feel like wanting to go through each resource and never feel ready for the job. The only to get out of it is building projects and testing things which you have learn.
